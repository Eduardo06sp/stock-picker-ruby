# Stock Picker

This particular project is a simple method implemented that takes an array of stock prices as an argument. It returns an array representing the best day to buy, then sell. Days start at 0.

Some of the lessons I had to learn include:
* Utilizing **nested iterators**
* Using a **range** to create a **subarray**
* Calculating index based on a **subarray**
* Keeping edge cases in mind when coding
